Carly Fiorina needs help. I m talking real, pharmaceutical-grade, billed at $400 an hour professional help, because she s seeing things that are not there again. This is just like that time she screamed like a banshee that she totally really did see live fetuses getting cut to bits in those Planned Parenthood videos, which were so obviously fake that not even other Republicans talk about them anymore.Megyn Kelly invited Fiorina onto her show to ask her just why in God s name she agreed to be, of all people, Ted Cruz s vice presidential candidate. He s the only person that Republicans genuinely hate more than Trump, yet she thought this was a good idea. So, what s the deal?Kelly asked Fiorina why she chose Cruz when he has no chance at securing the nomination by a majority of delegates. Fiorina immediately insisted that her math (this is the imaginary stuff now) says that Ted Cruz can win. She even blamed the media for this by saying they just wish it would be over and he [Trump] would be the GOP nominee. Here s some non-Carly math. Cruz has 562 delegates. He needs 1,237 to win. There are 578 still available. Even if he won 100 percent of all remaining ones he comes up nearly 100 delegates short. It s mathematically impossible for Ted Cruz to  win  and avoid a contested primary, yet she still said she believes Ted will win the nomination based on numbers only she can see.Carly Fiorina actually said that the majority of Republicans do not want Trump to win, to which Megyn Kelly just stared with a look of pity and bewilderment. Trump has beaten Cruz by up to 40 percent in the popular vote in some states recently. Apparently that isn t a majority anymore.Kelly then went on to point out that even though Trump isn t exactly the favorite of the party, there is no alternative. Cruz is still in it, but nobody is uniting behind him to stop Trump. Of course, Fiorina responded by telling Kelly she was wrong because there s a huge line of supporters flocking to Cruz   which again only she can see.Carly either sees things that do not actually exist, or she intentionally lies. I don t really know which is worse, but she thinks this qualifies her to be our next vice president.It s 2008 all over again. We have another mentally flawed person in the VP seat for Republicans   except this time, it s so bad she won t even get to the general election. Carly Fiorina should think long and hard about that. Sarah Palin made it closer to the vice presidency than she ever will. That has to sting.Watch Carly Fiorina prove how she can fail even in the most friendly of surroundings below:Featuerd image via video screen capture\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday said it will push to lock in fuel efficiency standards central to outgoing President Barack Obama\\u2019s climate policy before the Trump administration takes over in January.   Automakers had appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama\\u2019s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.  The EPA under law had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. Instead, the agency said it will end the public comment period by Dec. 30, and could move to lock in the rules after then and before the Obama administration leaves office on Jan. 20.  The EPA in a statement said it concluded after a lengthy review that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator, told reporters the technical record could \\u201carguably support strengthening the 2022 through 2025 standards,\\u201d but the EPA believes it \\u201cis not the time to introduce uncertainty by changing the standard.\\u201d She denied the impending administration change prompted the decision, but the EPA website previously showed a timeline that suggested a decision on mid-term review was not expected until mid-2017. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, blasted the decision, saying \\u201cthis extraordinary and premature rush to judgment circumvents the serious analysis necessary to make sure the (vehicle) standards appropriately balance fuel efficiency, carbon reduction, affordability and employment.\\u201d The group said it looked forward to working with the Trump administration on revisions and that \\u201cthe evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards.\\u201d It had previously asked Trump to review the automotive greenhouse gas rules, and other Obama administration actions that enable California and certain other states to mandate sales of electric vehicles. Environmental groups applauded the administration move and said they expect the EPA to finalize the rules by Jan. 20. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution?\\u201d said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington-based group that supports strong climate action. The Republican U.S. Congress or the Trump administration could seek to reverse or modify the rules. However, if the current EPA rules are locked in, it could make doing so more difficult and time consuming. Auto lobbyists said the next administration will have a variety of ways of reversing the EPA action, including reopening the technical assessment report. They also said the Obama administration\\u2019s move could backfire by bringing more attention to the issue early in the Trump administration.  Trump\\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 mpg, which the administration said would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. In July, EPA said because Americans are buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks that they now estimate the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. The agreement included a mid-term review to decide whether the 2022-2025 model year requirements were feasible. The California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the EPA decision \\u201cprovides solid support for continuation of the single national program to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.\\u201d \",\n          \"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the United States as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc.  Her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms.  Clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign. Since launching her campaign in April 2015, Clinton has said she wants to be the \\u201csmall business president\\u201d if she wins the Nov. 8 election against businessman Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help \\u201cjump-start America.\\u201d Clinton\\u2019s campaign held a conference call with small business owners on Tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of state\\u2019s campaign. \\u201cYou will always have a seat at the table,\\u201d Clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in Virginia and Michigan. Small businesses play a vital economic role in the United States, making up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of U.S. private-sector jobs, according to the Small Business Administration.  The proposals announced by Clinton\\u2019s campaign on Tuesday fill in details on how the Democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses. \\u201cThey tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in America,\\u201d Clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape,\\u201d Clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would-be entrepreneurs.  Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about U.S. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours. Clinton\\u2019s running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, discussed the new proposals during a Tuesday roundtable with small business owners in Colorado, a battleground state.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Oct 13, 2016\",\n          \"Dec 12, 2016\",\n          \"March 24, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Carly Fiorina needs help. I m talking real, pharmaceutical-grade, billed at $400 an hour professional help, because she s seeing things that are not there again. This is just like that time she screamed like a banshee that she totally really did see live fetuses getting cut to bits in those Planned Parenthood videos, which were so obviously fake that not even other Republicans talk about them anymore.Megyn Kelly invited Fiorina onto her show to ask her just why in God s name she agreed to be, of all people, Ted Cruz s vice presidential candidate. He s the only person that Republicans genuinely hate more than Trump, yet she thought this was a good idea. So, what s the deal?Kelly asked Fiorina why she chose Cruz when he has no chance at securing the nomination by a majority of delegates. Fiorina immediately insisted that her math (this is the imaginary stuff now) says that Ted Cruz can win. She even blamed the media for this by saying they just wish it would be over and he [Trump] would be the GOP nominee. Here s some non-Carly math. Cruz has 562 delegates. He needs 1,237 to win. There are 578 still available. Even if he won 100 percent of all remaining ones he comes up nearly 100 delegates short. It s mathematically impossible for Ted Cruz to  win  and avoid a contested primary, yet she still said she believes Ted will win the nomination based on numbers only she can see.Carly Fiorina actually said that the majority of Republicans do not want Trump to win, to which Megyn Kelly just stared with a look of pity and bewilderment. Trump has beaten Cruz by up to 40 percent in the popular vote in some states recently. Apparently that isn t a majority anymore.Kelly then went on to point out that even though Trump isn t exactly the favorite of the party, there is no alternative. Cruz is still in it, but nobody is uniting behind him to stop Trump. Of course, Fiorina responded by telling Kelly she was wrong because there s a huge line of supporters flocking to Cruz   which again only she can see.Carly either sees things that do not actually exist, or she intentionally lies. I don t really know which is worse, but she thinks this qualifies her to be our next vice president.It s 2008 all over again. We have another mentally flawed person in the VP seat for Republicans   except this time, it s so bad she won t even get to the general election. Carly Fiorina should think long and hard about that. Sarah Palin made it closer to the vice presidency than she ever will. That has to sting.Watch Carly Fiorina prove how she can fail even in the most friendly of surroundings below:Featuerd image via video screen capture\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday said it will push to lock in fuel efficiency standards central to outgoing President Barack Obama\\u2019s climate policy before the Trump administration takes over in January.   Automakers had appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama\\u2019s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.  The EPA under law had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. Instead, the agency said it will end the public comment period by Dec. 30, and could move to lock in the rules after then and before the Obama administration leaves office on Jan. 20.  The EPA in a statement said it concluded after a lengthy review that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator, told reporters the technical record could \\u201carguably support strengthening the 2022 through 2025 standards,\\u201d but the EPA believes it \\u201cis not the time to introduce uncertainty by changing the standard.\\u201d She denied the impending administration change prompted the decision, but the EPA website previously showed a timeline that suggested a decision on mid-term review was not expected until mid-2017. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, blasted the decision, saying \\u201cthis extraordinary and premature rush to judgment circumvents the serious analysis necessary to make sure the (vehicle) standards appropriately balance fuel efficiency, carbon reduction, affordability and employment.\\u201d The group said it looked forward to working with the Trump administration on revisions and that \\u201cthe evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards.\\u201d It had previously asked Trump to review the automotive greenhouse gas rules, and other Obama administration actions that enable California and certain other states to mandate sales of electric vehicles. Environmental groups applauded the administration move and said they expect the EPA to finalize the rules by Jan. 20. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution?\\u201d said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington-based group that supports strong climate action. The Republican U.S. Congress or the Trump administration could seek to reverse or modify the rules. However, if the current EPA rules are locked in, it could make doing so more difficult and time consuming. Auto lobbyists said the next administration will have a variety of ways of reversing the EPA action, including reopening the technical assessment report. They also said the Obama administration\\u2019s move could backfire by bringing more attention to the issue early in the Trump administration.  Trump\\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 mpg, which the administration said would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. In July, EPA said because Americans are buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks that they now estimate the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. The agreement included a mid-term review to decide whether the 2022-2025 model year requirements were feasible. The California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the EPA decision \\u201cprovides solid support for continuation of the single national program to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.\\u201d \",\n          \"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the United States as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc.  Her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms.  Clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign. Since launching her campaign in April 2015, Clinton has said she wants to be the \\u201csmall business president\\u201d if she wins the Nov. 8 election against businessman Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help \\u201cjump-start America.\\u201d Clinton\\u2019s campaign held a conference call with small business owners on Tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of state\\u2019s campaign. \\u201cYou will always have a seat at the table,\\u201d Clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in Virginia and Michigan. Small businesses play a vital economic role in the United States, making up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of U.S. private-sector jobs, according to the Small Business Administration.  The proposals announced by Clinton\\u2019s campaign on Tuesday fill in details on how the Democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses. \\u201cThey tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in America,\\u201d Clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape,\\u201d Clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would-be entrepreneurs.  Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about U.S. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours. Clinton\\u2019s running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, discussed the new proposals during a Tuesday roundtable with small business owners in Colorado, a battleground state.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Carly Fiorina needs help. I m talking real, pharmaceutical-grade, billed at $400 an hour professional help, because she s seeing things that are not there again. This is just like that time she screamed like a banshee that she totally really did see live fetuses getting cut to bits in those Planned Parenthood videos, which were so obviously fake that not even other Republicans talk about them anymore.Megyn Kelly invited Fiorina onto her show to ask her just why in God s name she agreed to be, of all people, Ted Cruz s vice presidential candidate. He s the only person that Republicans genuinely hate more than Trump, yet she thought this was a good idea. So, what s the deal?Kelly asked Fiorina why she chose Cruz when he has no chance at securing the nomination by a majority of delegates. Fiorina immediately insisted that her math (this is the imaginary stuff now) says that Ted Cruz can win. She even blamed the media for this by saying they just wish it would be over and he [Trump] would be the GOP nominee. Here s some non-Carly math. Cruz has 562 delegates. He needs 1,237 to win. There are 578 still available. Even if he won 100 percent of all remaining ones he comes up nearly 100 delegates short. It s mathematically impossible for Ted Cruz to  win  and avoid a contested primary, yet she still said she believes Ted will win the nomination based on numbers only she can see.Carly Fiorina actually said that the majority of Republicans do not want Trump to win, to which Megyn Kelly just stared with a look of pity and bewilderment. Trump has beaten Cruz by up to 40 percent in the popular vote in some states recently. Apparently that isn t a majority anymore.Kelly then went on to point out that even though Trump isn t exactly the favorite of the party, there is no alternative. Cruz is still in it, but nobody is uniting behind him to stop Trump. Of course, Fiorina responded by telling Kelly she was wrong because there s a huge line of supporters flocking to Cruz   which again only she can see.Carly either sees things that do not actually exist, or she intentionally lies. I don t really know which is worse, but she thinks this qualifies her to be our next vice president.It s 2008 all over again. We have another mentally flawed person in the VP seat for Republicans   except this time, it s so bad she won t even get to the general election. Carly Fiorina should think long and hard about that. Sarah Palin made it closer to the vice presidency than she ever will. That has to sting.Watch Carly Fiorina prove how she can fail even in the most friendly of surroundings below:Featuerd image via video screen capture\",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday said it will push to lock in fuel efficiency standards central to outgoing President Barack Obama\\u2019s climate policy before the Trump administration takes over in January.   Automakers had appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama\\u2019s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.  The EPA under law had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. Instead, the agency said it will end the public comment period by Dec. 30, and could move to lock in the rules after then and before the Obama administration leaves office on Jan. 20.  The EPA in a statement said it concluded after a lengthy review that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. Janet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator, told reporters the technical record could \\u201carguably support strengthening the 2022 through 2025 standards,\\u201d but the EPA believes it \\u201cis not the time to introduce uncertainty by changing the standard.\\u201d She denied the impending administration change prompted the decision, but the EPA website previously showed a timeline that suggested a decision on mid-term review was not expected until mid-2017. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, blasted the decision, saying \\u201cthis extraordinary and premature rush to judgment circumvents the serious analysis necessary to make sure the (vehicle) standards appropriately balance fuel efficiency, carbon reduction, affordability and employment.\\u201d The group said it looked forward to working with the Trump administration on revisions and that \\u201cthe evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards.\\u201d It had previously asked Trump to review the automotive greenhouse gas rules, and other Obama administration actions that enable California and certain other states to mandate sales of electric vehicles. Environmental groups applauded the administration move and said they expect the EPA to finalize the rules by Jan. 20. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution?\\u201d said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington-based group that supports strong climate action. The Republican U.S. Congress or the Trump administration could seek to reverse or modify the rules. However, if the current EPA rules are locked in, it could make doing so more difficult and time consuming. Auto lobbyists said the next administration will have a variety of ways of reversing the EPA action, including reopening the technical assessment report. They also said the Obama administration\\u2019s move could backfire by bringing more attention to the issue early in the Trump administration.  Trump\\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 mpg, which the administration said would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. In July, EPA said because Americans are buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks that they now estimate the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. The agreement included a mid-term review to decide whether the 2022-2025 model year requirements were feasible. The California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the EPA decision \\u201cprovides solid support for continuation of the single national program to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.\\u201d \",\n          \"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton on Tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the United States as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc.  Her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms.  Clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the Affordable Care Act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign. Since launching her campaign in April 2015, Clinton has said she wants to be the \\u201csmall business president\\u201d if she wins the Nov. 8 election against businessman Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help \\u201cjump-start America.\\u201d Clinton\\u2019s campaign held a conference call with small business owners on Tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of state\\u2019s campaign. \\u201cYou will always have a seat at the table,\\u201d Clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in Virginia and Michigan. Small businesses play a vital economic role in the United States, making up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of U.S. private-sector jobs, according to the Small Business Administration.  The proposals announced by Clinton\\u2019s campaign on Tuesday fill in details on how the Democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses. \\u201cThey tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in America,\\u201d Clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape,\\u201d Clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would-be entrepreneurs.  Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about U.S. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours. Clinton\\u2019s running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, discussed the new proposals during a Tuesday roundtable with small business owners in Colorado, a battleground state.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

the u.s. environmental protection agency on wednesday said it will push to lock in fuel efficiency standards central to outgoing president barack obama\\u2019s climate policy before the trump administration takes over in january.   automakers had appealed to president-elect donald trump, who has been critical of obama\\u2019s climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences.  the epa under law had to decide by april 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. instead, the agency said it will end the public comment period by dec. 30, and could move to lock in the rules after then and before the obama administration leaves office on jan. 20.  the epa in a statement said it concluded after a lengthy review that automakers can meet the 2025 standards. janet mccabe, epa acting assistant administrator, told reporters the technical record could \\u201carguably support strengthening the 2022 through 2025 standards,\\u201d but the epa believes it \\u201cis not the time to introduce uncertainty by changing the standard.\\u201d she denied the impending administration change prompted the decision, but the epa website previously showed a timeline that suggested a decision on mid-term review was not expected until mid-2017. the alliance of automobile manufacturers, a trade group representing general motors co, ford motor co, toyota motor corp, volkswagen ag (vowg_p.de) and others, blasted the decision, saying \\u201cthis extraordinary and premature rush to judgment circumvents the serious analysis necessary to make sure the (vehicle) standards appropriately balance fuel efficiency, carbon reduction, affordability and employment.\\u201d the group said it looked forward to working with the trump administration on revisions and that \\u201cthe evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards.\\u201d it had previously asked trump to review the automotive greenhouse gas rules, and other obama administration actions that enable california and certain other states to mandate sales of electric vehicles. environmental groups applauded the administration move and said they expect the epa to finalize the rules by jan. 20. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution?\\u201d said daniel becker, director of the safe climate campaign, a washington-based group that supports strong climate action. the republican u.s. congress or the trump administration could seek to reverse or modify the rules. however, if the current epa rules are locked in, it could make doing so more difficult and time consuming. auto lobbyists said the next administration will have a variety of ways of reversing the epa action, including reopening the technical assessment report. they also said the obama administration\\u2019s move could backfire by bringing more attention to the issue early in the trump administration.  trump\\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  in 2011, obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 mpg, which the administration said would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. in july, epa said because americans are buying fewer cars and more suvs and trucks that they now estimate the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025. the agreement included a mid-term review to decide whether the 2022-2025 model year requirements were feasible. the california air resources board chair mary nichols said the epa decision \\u201cprovides solid support for continuation of the single national program to produce a new generation of clean vehicles.\\u201d \",\n          \"los angeles (reuters) - democrat hillary clinton on tuesday vowed to make starting a small business in the united states as easy as opening a lemonade stand if elected president, targeting a large economic sector and a significant voting bloc.  her flagship proposal is to establish a standard tax deduction for small businesses, previously only available to individuals, allowing owners to get tax relief without filing additional forms.  clinton would also expand healthcare tax credits in the affordable care act for small businesses that employ up to 50 workers and create new federal incentives for local and state governments to streamline the business licensing process, according to background provided by her campaign. since launching her campaign in april 2015, clinton has said she wants to be the \\u201csmall business president\\u201d if she wins the nov. 8 election against businessman donald trump, the republican nominee. trump has offered lower tax rates for small businesses and cuts to federal regulations to help \\u201cjump-start america.\\u201d clinton\\u2019s campaign held a conference call with small business owners on tuesday to discuss her proposals and offer ways they could help with the former secretary of state\\u2019s campaign. \\u201cyou will always have a seat at the table,\\u201d clinton told business owners on the call, taking questions from entrepreneurs in virginia and michigan. small businesses play a vital economic role in the united states, making up 99.7 percent of u.s. employer firms and providing 49.2 percent of u.s. private-sector jobs, according to the small business administration.  the proposals announced by clinton\\u2019s campaign on tuesday fill in details on how the democratic nominee would fulfill promises to improve access to financing and minimize regulatory burdens that make it difficult to start small businesses. \\u201cthey tell me more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere in america,\\u201d clinton said of the feedback she has received from small business owners. \\u201ci\\u2019d like to get rid of the unnecessary red tape,\\u201d clinton said of regulations on credit unions and small banks that make it difficult to lend to would-be entrepreneurs.  clinton\\u2019s campaign said she also wants to guarantee that small businesses with questions about u.s. government regulations receive an answer within 24 hours. clinton\\u2019s running mate, u.s. senator tim kaine, discussed the new proposals during a tuesday roundtable with small business owners in colorado, a battleground state.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"left-news\",\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

saying they just wish it would be over and he trump would be the gop nominee here s some noncarly math cruz has 562 delegates he needs 1237 to win there are 578 still available even if he won 100

in fuel efficiency standards central to outgoing president barack obama\\u2019s climate policy before the trump administration takes over in january   automakers had appealed to presidentelect donald trump who has been critical of obama\\u2019s climate policies to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleetwide fuel efficiency by 2025 saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences  the epa under law had to decide by april 2018 whether to modify the 20222025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleetwide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon instead the agency said it will end the public comment period by dec 30 and could move to lock in the rules after then and before the obama administration leaves office on jan 20  the epa in a statement said it concluded after a lengthy review that automakers can meet the 2025 standards janet mccabe epa acting assistant administrator told reporters the technical record could \\u201carguably support strengthening the 2022 through 2025 standards\\u201d but the epa believes it \\u201cis not the time to introduce uncertainty by changing the standard\\u201d she denied the impending administration change prompted the decision but the epa website previously showed a timeline that suggested a decision on midterm review was not expected until mid2017 the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing general motors co ford motor co toyota motor corp volkswagen ag vowgpde and others blasted the decision saying \\u201cthis extraordinary and premature rush to judgment circumvents the serious analysis necessary to make sure the vehicle standards appropriately balance fuel efficiency carbon reduction affordability and employment\\u201d the group said it looked forward to working with the trump administration on revisions and that \\u201cthe evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards\\u201d it had previously asked trump to review the automotive greenhouse gas rules and other obama administration actions that enable california and certain other states to mandate sales of electric vehicles environmental groups applauded the administration move and said they expect the epa to finalize the rules by jan 20 \\u201cwhat\\u2019s not to like about a plan agreed to by the automakers that cuts oil use saves money at the pump and reduces pollution\\u201d said daniel becker director of the safe climate campaign a washingtonbased group that supports strong climate action the republican us congress or the trump administration could seek to reverse or modify the rules however if the current epa rules are locked in it could make doing so more difficult and time consuming auto lobbyists said the next administration will have a variety of ways of reversing the epa action including reopening the technical assessment report they also said the obama administration\\u2019s move could backfire by bringing more attention to the issue early in the trump administration  trump\\u2019s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment  in 2011 obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 545 mpg which the administration said would save motorists 17 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about 200 billion over 13 years in july epa said because americans are buying fewer cars and more suvs and trucks that they now estimate the fleet will average 508 mpg to 526 mpg in 2025 the agreement included a midterm review to decide whether the 20222025 model year requirements were feasible the california air
